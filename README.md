Data Set for Random Sampling Blog Post

This GIT repository contains my working materials for a blog post on sampling.  
My point, hopefully made, was that the role of sampling is limited but important, i.e. 
a sample should reflect the composition of the general population to limit the effect 
non-determinant covariants.  I was prompted on this issue after I read a Magistrate 
Judge's decision on a discovery motion.  What struck me was the apparent lack of 
fundamental understanding of the underlying priciples.  Clearly, I could have been 
misinterpreting the Judges' words or perhaps taken them out of context, but the 
import of the comment seemed pretty clear.  

A secondary goal was to present the underlying data to the reader.  Beyond the 
frustration due to a lack of understanding, I am also frustrated by the gamesmanship 
that comes with legal wrangling.  From a legal
perspective, the defendants have a point, the rule does not require them to produce
"non-responsive" documents; however, from a statistical perspective you need the 
non-responsive documents, i.e. noise, to properly model the data.  This git 
is a baby step towards transparency.  Here's the data. blemishes, noise and all.
